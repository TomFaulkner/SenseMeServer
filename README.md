# SenseMeServer
Python REST API Server for SenseMe devices

Not much to see here at the moment, but the idea is a Hug based REST API to access and control SenseMe devices using the [SenseMe library](https://github.com/TomFaulkner/SenseMe "SenseMe library").

# Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Hug (version tbd.)

The SenseMe library requires Python 3.6 for fstrings. This project is relying on the ordered nature of dictionaries in 3.6.

# Future
Once this is ready for use I'll include a Dockerfile for ease of use.
